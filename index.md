I am a final year PhD researcher at the [STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/), Lancaster University.

My research interests include **large-scale combinatorial optimisation**, **robust optimisation**, and **evolutionary algorithms**. In particular, a large part of my work has been in collaboration with Sellafield Ltd, focussing on the efficient construction of large-scale schedules for the decommissioning of the Sellafield nuclear site.
