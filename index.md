I am a final year PhD researcher at the STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training, Lancaster University.

My research interests include large-scale combinatorial optimisation, robust optimisation, evolutionary algorithms. In particular, a large part of my work has been in collaboration with Sellafield Ltd, focussing on the efficient construction of large-scale schedules for the decommissioning of the Sellafield nuclear site.
